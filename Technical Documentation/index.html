         <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
         </code>
           </header>
           <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.</p>
           <p>Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It seems that everything relies on computers and the internet now—communication (e.g., email, smartphones, tablets), entertainment (e.g., interactive video games, social media, apps ), transportation (e.g., navigation systems), shopping (e.g., online shopping, credit cards), medicine (e.g., medical equipment, medical records), and the list goes on.</p>

           <p>A strong cybersecurity strategy has layers of protection to defend against cyber crime, including cyber attacks that attempt to access, change, or destroy data; extort money from users or the organization; or aim to disrupt normal business operations. Countermeasures should address:</p>
           <p>:-Application security </p>
           <p>:-Network security </p>
           <p>:-Critical infrastructure security </p>
           <p>:-Cloud security</p>

           </code>
           </header>
           <p>The volume of cybersecurity incidents is on the rise across the globe, but misconceptions continue to persist, including the notion that:

<h5>Cybercriminals are outsiders</h5> 
           <p>:-In reality, cybersecurity breaches are often the result of malicious insiders, working for themselves or in concert with outside hackers. These insiders can be a part of well-organized groups, backed by nation-states.</p>
<h5>Risks are well-known</h5> 
           <p>:-In fact, the risk surface is still expanding, with thousands of new vulnerabilities being reported in old and new applications and devices. And opportunities for human error - specifically by negligent employees or contractors who unintentionally cause a data breach - keep increasing.</p>
<h5>Attack vectors are contained</h5><p>:-Cybercriminals are finding new attack vectors all the time - including Linux systems, operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and cloud environments.</p>

           <p>Cyberattacks target computer systems and frameworks. These attacks work to disable, steal, or alter data and information. Cell phones, personal computers, company laptops, and internal corporate networks all risk cyberattacks.
Many types of cybersecurity threats exist, with developments occurring regularly. Some of the most common cyberattacks include:</p>
         <h5>Malware attacks</h5><p>:- Malicious software such as ransomware, viruses, and spyware are downloaded onto a user’s computer system, typically through a fraudulent link.</p>
           <h5>Phishing scams</h5><p>:- Seemingly trustworthy emails or websites entice users into clicking a dangerous link that installs malware on their devices.</p>
           <h5>Spear phishing scams</h5><p>:- These sophisticated phishing attacks target companies and organizations, typically executives.</p>
           <h5>Denial of service attacks</h5><p>:- High traffic flooding shuts down websites, servers, and network systems.</p>
           <h5>Password attacks</h5><p>:- An attempt to breach password protections by cracking or guessing passwords using software.</p>
           <h5>SQL injections</h5><p>:- Deceptive website programming code that grants access to network databases.</p>

           <p>The following best practices and technologies can help your organization implement strong cybersecurity that reduces your vulnerability to cyber attacks and protects your critical information systems, without intruding on the user or customer experience:</p>

<p>Identity and access management (IAM) defines the roles and access privileges for each user, as well as the conditions under which they are granted or denied their privileges. IAM methodologies include single sign-on, which enables a user to log in to a network once without re-entering credentials during the same session; multifactor authentication, requiring two or more access credentials; privileged user accounts, which grant administrative privileges to certain users only; and user lifecycle management, which manages each user's identity and access privileges from initial registration through retirement. IAM tools can also give your cybersecurity professionals deeper visibility into suspicious activity on end-user devices, including endpoints they can’t physically access. This helps speed investigation and response times to isolate and contain the damage of a breach.</p>
           <p> A comprehensive data security platform protects sensitive information across multiple environments, including hybrid multicloud environments. The best data security platforms provide automated, real-time visibility into data vulnerabilities, as well as ongoing monitoring that alerts them to data vulnerabilities and risks before they become data breaches; they should also simplify compliance with government and industry data privacy regulations. Backups and encryption are also vital for keeping data safe.</p>

<p>Security information and event management (SIEM) aggregates and analyzes data from security events to automatically detect suspicious user activities and trigger a preventative or remedial response. Today SIEM solutions include advanced detection methods such as user behavior analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). SIEM can automatically prioritize cyber threat response in line with your organization's risk management objectives. And many organizations are integrating their SIEM tools with security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) platforms that further automate and accelerate an organizations response to cybersecurity incidents, and resolve many incidents without human intervention.   </p>

          <p>Businesses today are connected like never before. Your systems, users and data all live and operate in different environments. Perimeter-based security is no longer adequate but implementing security controls within each environment creates complexity. The result in both cases is degraded protection for your most important assets. A zero trust strategy assumes compromise and sets up controls to validate every user, device and connection into the business for authenticity and purpose. To be successful executing a zero trust strategy, organizations need a way to combine security information in order to generate the context (device security, location, etc.) that informs and enforces validation controls.</p>

              <p>:-Integrating cloud into your existing enterprise security program is not just adding a few more controls or point solutions. It requires an assessment of your resources and business needs to develop a fresh approach to your culture and cloud security strategy.</p>
              <p>:-Protect enterprise data across multiple environments, meet privacy regulations and simplify operational complexity.</p>
